**•	Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?**

  For this project, I was provided with starter code that defined the game environment, including the maze layout, reward system, and helper classes for experience replay and visualization. I was responsible for designing and implementing the core deep Q-learning training algorithm that allowed the pirate agent to learn how to navigate the maze and reach the treasure. This included managing exploration versus exploitation, storing and replaying experiences, training a neural network to estimate Q-values, and tuning the training process so the agent could reliably solve the maze from different starting positions.
  
**•	Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science**

**o	What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?**

Computer scientists design, build, and evaluate systems that solve real-world problems using computational thinking. This matters because many modern challenges, from navigation systems to automation and decision-making tools, depend on reliable algorithms that can adapt to complex environments. In this course, I saw how reinforcement learning allows machines to learn from interaction rather than relying solely on hard-coded rules

**o	How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?**

When approaching problems, I focus on breaking the problem down into manageable components, selecting appropriate algorithms, testing assumptions, and iterating based on results. In this project, that meant understanding the environment, defining meaningful rewards, and refining the learning process when performance issues appeared.

**o	What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?**

Computer scientists have an ethical responsibility to consider how their systems behave and who they affect. Intelligent agents must be designed to act predictably, avoid harmful behavior, and align with user and organizational goals. Even in a simplified game environment, this project reinforced the importance of transparency, testing, and accountability when building systems that make decisions autonomously
